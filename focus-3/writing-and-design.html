            <h3>Integrating Writing & Design</h3>
            <p>I took Pitt’s Integrating Writing & Design class in Fall 2020. The aim of this course is to
              study the rhetorical implications of design and writing. I used InDesign and Photoshop to create various
              documents and graphics with a focus on utilizing design to enhance the content of a written work.
              Here are some pieces I created for the class with descriptions of the assignments they were created for.</p>

            <h3>Black Love Matters</h3>
            <p>Black Love Matters is a four-page magazine spread I created for my final portfolio based on the photo essay of the same name by Zun Lee, a visual artist whose work mainly focuses on the everyday life of Black people.
              I (virtually) heard Lee speak at the Center for African American Poetry and Poetics’ Black Study Intensive in fall 2020. This is where I was introduced to
              Black Love Matters — a collection of photos depicting the everyday life of the Black citizens of Ferguson, MO after the killing of Michael Brown in 2014. In reality, this piece is a
              series of about a dozen photos, but I reimagined it as if Lee had written a feature story to accompany the photos.</p>
            <p>Page one resembles a Black Lives Matter poster and credits Lee. The second page is the start of the story and highlights one of Lee’s photos. The next spread continues the story and contains other photos,
              as well as a pull quote and image credit. I wanted to keep this design simple in order to draw attention to the photos and the text,
              as opposed to any flashy colors or design elements. </p>

          <li class="card-description"> <!--Instagram Story Description-->
            <h3>Instagram Story</h3>
            <p>One of our assignments was to create an Instagram Story using InDesign. I took the Instagram Story assignment as an opportunity to create something that I could potentially
              use for my work at The Pitt News as we head into our next hiring cycle. I used the TPN colors and fonts consistently throughout and used several images from our archive to
              depict life at Pitt and what potential employees could see and report on while working for the paper. This was my first-ever attempt at creating an Instagram Story.</p>

            <h3>Here's Hough</h3>
            <p>I created this piece for the small business logo assignment. We could either pick a real small business or create a fictional one. I decided to pick my
              great aunt’s interior design business — Here’s Hough. She operated her business out of her home on Long Beach Island, NJ for several decades
              and retired in 2019. I made this logo for her and shared it with other family members as well.</p>

            <h3>Combat Sports</h3>
            <p>For my four-page spread assignment, I reimagined the vinyl packaging of the album Combat Sports by The Vaccines. I’ve always found the relationship between text and images interesting in vinyl packaging. Cover art and design are essential, but so is a clear presentation of the lyrics,
              album credits, etc. Combat Sports is one of my favorite albums and has one of my favorite album covers, but I wanted to reimagine the cover and design that leans more into the themes that the title of the album brings to mind. I tried to stylize the cover as a fight poster, using a
              vintage boxing picture and editing it in Photoshop to place on the cover and stylized the tracklisting on the back to be like a fight lineup (Side A vs. Side B). Instead of the serif font that
              is on the original cover, I used the band’s traditional logo font (Bebas Neue Bold). I kept the original color scheme.</p>
