        <p>Welcome to Mary Rose O'Donnell's Portfolio.
This GitHub portfolio website was created as a team effort between Mary Rose O'Donnell and Joshua Ford. The project was conceived of and designed as a Capstone Project for the Digital Narrative and Intereactive Design major at the University of Pittsburgh. By collaborating with our peers and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim of Pitt's Department of Informatics and Networked Systems in our Team-Based Capstone Project Course, we were able to create the website you see now.
We were also joined by Jennifer Welton, Director of Corporate Relations at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information, who advised us on the design and function of the site in regards to the employers that we will send it to.</p>
